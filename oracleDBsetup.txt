1) Run through the Node-oracledb installation instructions here for your system: https://github.com/oracle/node-oracledb/blob/master/INSTALL.md
   (It also requires Python 2.7 and a C Compiler, which you likely already have installed, but install them if you do not)

2) npm install dotenv
3) Create a file .env that will not be committed to the GitHub repository (it's already in .gitignore)
4) Inside of .env, add two lines:
    DB_USER='ACTUAL DATABASE USERNAME'
    DB_PASSWORD='ACTUAL DATABASE PW'
   (Be sure to replace the quotes with the actual username and password which can be found in a file in the shared Google Drive)

5) I've added a function inside of app.js, handleDatabaseConnection, that takes in a database query, a list of values to substitute into the query, and a callback function that explains what should be done with the result once it is received.
6) To test the connection, add the following lines near the top of app.js (be sure to remove them once you've finished testing):
    handleDatabaseConnection('SELECT * FROM airports WHERE city = :city', ['Philadelphia'], function(result) {
      console.log(result.rows);
    });
7) The above also should print out the resulting query to your terminal window. It also serves as an example of how to use the function.
8) It turns out that the oracledb package introduces a bug where pressing Ctrl + C to exit out of the server doesn't actually work. I've added a couple of lines that start with "process.on('SIGINT', function() {" to handle this bug. If you need to perform any actions when quitting the server, you should add them here.
